ESPLIGHT protocol:

"EspFind": Returns name of device as set by user
"*ESP_ID": Returns "{DEVICE_NAME,FIRMWARE_VERSION,DEVICE_TYPE,<Name of device as set by user>,<Enabled interfaces>,[0:<pwmchannels>,1:<ws2801channels>,2:<ws2812channels>]}"
"?<statement>&<statement>&<statement>": Command.

---
Supported command statements:
"pin": Security PIN, if device is protected using a PIN this statement has to be the first statement sent, in order to authenticate the execution of the other statements in the command.

"effect": Sets the action to be executed. Values are:
  - '0': Set all leds connected to the selected interfaces to color (R:var0, G:var1, B:var2)
  - '1': Fading effect (not implemented)
  - '2': Digital fading / Rainbow (not implemented)
  - '3': Push color into buffer of selected interfaces (R:var0, G:var1, B:var2)
  - '4': Set pixel in buffer of selected interfaces (R: var0, G:var1, B:var2, Pixel:pixel)
  - '5': Send buffer to output (only needed if autoupdate is disabled)

"brightness": Sets the brightness of the color set using var0, var1 and var2
"pixel": Sets which pixel should be changed
"interface": Sets which interfaces should be changed
"autoupdate": Enables or disables the automatic updating of the ledstrips

"var0", "var1", "var2": Variables, usage depends on effect

----
Interfaces:
Bit 1: PWM
Bit 2: WS2801
Bit 3: WS2812
Bit 4-16: Reserved


----

Examples:

?effect=0&var0=255&var1=255&var2=255&brightness=255&autoupdate=1&interface=7
 - Sets all leds on all interfaces to white (full brightness)

?effect=0&var0=255&var1=0&var2=0&brightness=255&autoupdate=1&interface=1
 - Sets PWM output to red (full brightness)

?effect=3&var0=255&var1=0&var2=0&brightness=255&autoupdate=1&interface=2
 - Pushes a pixel with color "red, full brightness" into the buffer of the WS2801 output
